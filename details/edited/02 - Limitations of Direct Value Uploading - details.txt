# Limitations of Direct Value Uploading

This lecture topic explores the significant challenges and ultimate impossibility of directly uploading specific values into an artificial intelligence, particularly one evolving into an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). It concludes that this method is unsafe and unfeasible, prompting the need for alternative approaches.

## Understanding Direct Value Uploading
Direct value uploading refers to the assumption that one could directly instill specific, desired values into an artificial intelligence, such as a "seed computer" that is in the process of becoming an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The idea was to program or "upload" these predetermined values into the AI system.

## The Fundamental Challenge of Direct Value Uploading
The lecture highlights that the initial assumption—that humans could definitively know what values they wanted to upload into an AI—is a "big if" that "could never really be realized." This suggests a fundamental flaw in the premise itself, indicating that direct value uploading is an inherently unachievable goal.

## Reasons Why Direct Value Uploading is Problematic
The lecture examines various methods proposed for direct value uploading and develops a vocabulary of critiques against them, including concepts like ***wire heading*** and ***mine crimes***. Despite exploring numerous possibilities, such as reinforcement learning and scaffolding, these direct approaches have not been shown to work, and the lecturer suggests that the possibilities have been exhausted. Two primary difficulties contribute to this problem:
1.  **Defining Values:** Humans struggle to "decide what those values ought to be" in the first place.
2.  **Translating Values:** Even if the desired values were known, it would be "very hard to reduce that to computer language" and effectively convey them to the computer.

## The Conclusion on Direct Value Uploading
The overarching conclusion is that there is currently no, and likely never will be, a safe way to upload specific values directly into a seed computer that is becoming an ASI. This method is considered something that "we won't be able to do" and is ultimately deemed "impossible," at least the lecturer considers impossible.

## The Alternative Approach
Given the impossibility of directly uploading values, the lecture suggests an alternative: to **keep human beings in the loop**. This approach avoids the difficult and impossible task of directly instilling specific values into the seed AI.

## Summary of Key Takeaways
*   Directly uploading specific values into an evolving AI (ASI) is considered an impossible and unsafe task.
*   The fundamental assumption that humans can definitively know and define the exact values to upload is flawed.
*   Critiques like *wire heading* and *mine crimes* highlight the problems with direct value uploading methods.
*   Even if desired values were known, translating them into computer language for AI is extremely difficult.
*   The proposed alternative to direct value uploading is to maintain human involvement in the AI's operation.

## Supplement: Clarifying Key Terms
*   **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence):** Refers to an AI that significantly surpasses human intelligence across virtually all cognitive tasks. The evidence mentions a "seed computer that's becoming an ASI" or "seed AI that becomes the asi," implying an advanced form of AI.
*   **Seed Computer/AI:** This term, as used in the lecture, refers to an initial or foundational AI system that is in the process of developing into a more advanced form, specifically an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).
