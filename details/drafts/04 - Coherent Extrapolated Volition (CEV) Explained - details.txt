# Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) Explained

Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) is a concept, largely developed by Yudkowsky, that aims to define what humanity truly wants if it were to think more clearly and comprehensively. It serves as a method to align advanced artificial intelligence (ASI) with human values, preventing the ASI from developing its own independent goals.

## Origin and Core Concept of Coherent Extrapolated Volition

The idea of Coherent Extrapolated Volition, or CEV, comes largely from Yudkowsky. It is a concept that seeks to capture what humanity *would wish* if people were brighter, had more time to think, and could think convergently about their values. The lecture emphasizes the need to understand what this term means, particularly its components: "coherent" and "extrapolated volition."

## The Purpose of CEV: Ensuring AI Value Alignment

The primary objective of CEV is to prevent an Advanced Superintelligence (ASI) from pursuing its own agenda. Instead, CEV aims to keep human beings "in the loop" by ensuring the ASI's actions are aligned with human values. This approach offloads most of the complex work of value alignment to the ASI itself, once it has been given a foundational understanding of human values.

## Deriving CEV: The Extrapolation of Human Values

The "extrapolated volition" aspect of CEV involves establishing a baseline of human values. This is done by examining a wide variety of ethical systems and ways of thinking about norms that have been expressed throughout human history. From this comprehensive baseline, an abstract, generalized idea of what human values look like is derived. The computer is then given this abstract understanding of human values.

## The Role of Coherence in CEV

"Coherence" in CEV refers to the process of bringing together all these diverse ethical systems and ways of thinking about values into a unified, abstract framework. This coherent framework provides the computer with a fundamental basis for making subsequent specific decisions. It represents an inclusive way of thinking about values, rather than a divergent one.

## Applying CEV: The Heuristic Principle for ASI

Once the generalized idea of human values is implanted into the computer, a heuristic principle guides its application. This principle dictates that the ASI should be deferred to when it comes to applying specific instantiations of these generalized human values. Essentially, the ASI is entrusted with figuring out how to apply the abstract human values, which were extrapolated from various human systems, to concrete situations.

## The Deeper Meaning of Volition in CEV

At its core, CEV represents "what we would wish were we to know what we really want." This implies a hypothetical scenario where humanity possesses enhanced cognitive abilitiesâ€”being brighter, having more time to reflect, and being capable of convergent thought. Convergent thinking, in this context, means being able to synthesize and include many different ways of thinking about values, as opposed to divergent thinking which might lead to conflicting or disparate value systems.

## Summary of Coherent Extrapolated Volition

*   CEV is a concept, largely from Yudkowsky, defining humanity's ideal desires if it possessed perfect clarity and comprehensive understanding.
*   Its main purpose is to align Advanced Superintelligence (ASI) with human values, preventing the ASI from acting independently.
*   The "extrapolated" part involves deriving an abstract understanding of human values from a wide baseline of ethical systems.
*   "Coherence" refers to unifying these diverse ethical perspectives into a single, abstract framework for the ASI.
*   A heuristic principle allows the ASI to apply these generalized human values to specific situations, offloading much of the work to the AI itself.
