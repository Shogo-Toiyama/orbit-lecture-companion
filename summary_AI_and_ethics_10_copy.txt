[The Core Challenge of ASI Trustworthiness]
Summary: The ongoing development of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) necessitates immediate concern for its trustworthiness and safety, often termed "friendly AI." This concept, largely influenced by autodidact Yudkowsky, emphasizes preventing ASI from causing harm, particularly human extinction, whether through malice or inadvertent actions due to misunderstanding its nature.

[The Impracticality of Direct Value Uploads]
Summary: Attempts to directly instill specific human values into a seed AI system are deemed unfeasible, as methods like wireheading and mind crimes demonstrate the difficulty of reducing complex values to computer language. Despite exploring numerous approaches like reinforcement learning and scaffolding, a safe and effective way to upload values has not been found, leading to the conclusion that direct value programming is likely impossible.

[Indirect Normativity: Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)]
Summary: Given the challenges of direct value uploading, an alternative approach called "indirect normativity" is proposed, centered on the concept of Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV). This method aims to keep human values in the AI loop without requiring direct, specific value programming, instead seeking an abstract understanding of human values.

[CEV: Deriving Abstract Human Values from a Baseline]
Summary: CEV proposes offloading much of the value alignment work to the ASI itself by providing it with an abstract understanding of human values. This is achieved by creating a baseline derived from a wide variety of ethical systems and human norms, allowing the ASI to extrapolate a generalized sense of "what it means to be human and having human values."

[CEV as a Heuristic for AI Decision-Making]
Summary: The heuristic principle of CEV is to defer to the ASI regarding the application of specific instantiations of these generalized human values. The ASI is meant to understand "what we would wish were we to know what we really want," implying a convergent, inclusive understanding of human values if humans had unlimited time and cognitive ability to reflect.

[CEV's Advantage Over Rule-Based AI Systems]
Summary: CEV is considered more tractable than implementing explicit rules because rules are open to interpretation and difficult for AI to follow effectively, mirroring how humans don't strictly follow rules in daily life. Unlike rigid rules that are easily misinterpreted, CEV is open-ended, providing an abstract thought or intention that allows the ASI to make concrete decisions while remaining adaptable.

[The "Do As I Mean, Not As I Say" Principle]
Summary: The essence of CEV can be summarized as the AI acting according to the implied intention ("do as I mean") rather than a literal interpretation of explicit commands ("not as I say"). This philosophical shift aims to resolve the ambiguity inherent in direct instructions, allowing the ASI to make decisions based on a deeper, extrapolated understanding of human desire, even if humans themselves cannot fully articulate it.
