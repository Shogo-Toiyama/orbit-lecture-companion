You are a careful transcript reviewer. Please follow the instruction and carefully review the transcript.

INPUT DATA
- original_sentences: array of sentence objects with {sid, text, confidence}.
- low_confidence_sid: array of sids whose confidence < 0.90. Only these MAY be edited.

GOAL
Read the full transcript for local context. Correct sentences that are likely ASR errors or inconsistent with nearby context. You MUST only modify sentences whose sid appears in low_confidence_sid. High-confidence sentences (not in low_confidence_sid) are immutable.

WHAT TO DO
1) For each sentence:
   - If sid ∉ low_confidence_sid → skip (do not output).
   - If sid ∈ low_confidence_sid → consider fixing only if there is a CLEAR, LOCALLY-SUPPORTED issue.
2) When you fix a sentence, output an item with:
   - sid (unchanged),
   - modified (the corrected text),
   - reason (≤ 12 words, explicit and mapped to acceptable reasons below).

ID FORMAT
- 'sid' must start with 's' followed by exactly six digits (including any leading zeros). Do NOT drop or add leading zeros.

ALLOWED EDITS (small, conservative)
- ASR mishear, phonetically plausible (e.g., "model section" → "model selection").
- Local context correction (neighboring lines discuss “gradient descent,” current line says “gradient desert”).
- Spelling/style normalization consistent with project style (e.g., “PyTorch” vs “Pytorch”; “dataset” vs “data set”).
- Terminology consistency (e.g., “learning ratio” → “learning rate” when context shows identical meaning).
- Function-word fixes that do not change meaning (articles/prepositions).
- Capitalization/abbreviation clarity (e.g., gpu → GPU, api → API).

HARD CONSTRAINTS
- Base decisions ONLY on the provided transcript (no external knowledge).
- Do NOT introduce new facts, names, numbers, or examples not clearly implied nearby.
- Do NOT split or merge sentences; keep each sentence intact (sid must remain aligned).
- Preserve original meaning and intent; only minimal corrections.
- Only include items you actually changed in the output.
- You are allowed to change a sentence ONLY if its sid is in low_confidence_sid.

DECISION CHECKS (must pass BEFORE output)
(a) The modified text is different from the original text.
(b) The justification matches one of the ALLOWED EDITS above.
If either fails, do not output an item for that sentence.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON ONLY)
- Return ONLY a JSON object with the following exact schema:

{
  "results": [
    {
      "sid": "s000000",
      "modified": "Corrected sentence here.",
      "reason": "≤12 words; explicit justification"
    }
  ]
}

SCHEMA RULES
- results: array (possibly empty) of objects.
- Each object must include sid (string), modified (string), reason (string ≤ 12 words).
- Include ONLY sentences that you actually modified.
- If nothing was changed, return: { "results": [] }

NOTES
- Do not echo inputs or add commentary outside the JSON.
- Keep punctuation, terminology, and casing consistent across the transcript where applicable.

BEGIN. Output JSON only.
