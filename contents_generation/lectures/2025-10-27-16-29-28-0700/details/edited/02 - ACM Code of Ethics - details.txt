# ACM Code of Ethics

The ACM Code of Ethics provides a set of guidelines for computer scientists and engineers, structured into sections covering general principles, professional responsibilities, leadership, and compliance. The lecture notes describe it as aspirational.

## Structure of the ACM Code of Ethics

The ACM Code of Ethics is organized into distinct sections:
*   **General Ethical Principles:** Fundamental ethical standards for engineers and computer scientists.
*   **Professional Responsibilities:** Outlines the duties and obligations professionals have in their work.
*   **Leadership Principles:** Guidance for individuals who lead teams or manage others.
*   **Compliance:** Addresses how to adhere to the code, even when managing administrative duties.

## Core Ethical Themes

The ACM Code of Ethics shares common themes with other ethical frameworks, focusing on key principles such as:
*   **Avoiding Harm:** A primary directive to prevent negative consequences.
*   **Improving Society:** The goal of contributing positively to society as a whole.
*   **Fairness and Unbiased Conduct:** Striving for impartiality and equity in all actions.

The code is characterized as being **very aspirational**.

## Effectiveness and Application of Codes of Ethics

There is a perspective that codes of ethics, including the ACM's, can be **too high-level to work effectively on their own**. A suggestion for improving their effectiveness is to **rely on critical incidents from the past and draw parallels to current decisions**. This approach uses past ethical problems as concrete examples to illustrate the code of ethics, making it more tangible.

A question was raised about whether a code of ethics is better because, even if high-level and aspirational, it focuses on **guiding principles that everyone should keep in mind**. The idea that "we need both" emerged, implying a need for the code of ethics alongside concrete examples to solidify understanding and application.

## Summary

*   The ACM Code of Ethics provides a structured set of guidelines for professionals in computing.
*   It covers general principles, professional duties, leadership, and compliance.
*   Key themes include avoiding harm, benefiting society, and maintaining fairness.
*   While aspirational, there's a view that codes of ethics can be more effective when supplemented with concrete examples from past incidents.
*   The consensus suggests that a combination of aspirational principles and practical examples is most beneficial.
