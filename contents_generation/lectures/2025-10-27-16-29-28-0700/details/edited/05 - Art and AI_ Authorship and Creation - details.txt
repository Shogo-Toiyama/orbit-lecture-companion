# Art and AI: Authorship and Creation

This lecture explores the complex questions surrounding authorship and creation when artificial intelligence is involved in the artistic process. It delves into whether AI-generated or AI-assisted art can be considered "created" by a human, and what defines the role of the artist versus the tool.

## The Evolving Definition of Creation

The core of the discussion revolves around who is the creator when AI is used in art. The lecture uses examples to question whether the human who prompts the AI, the AI itself, or even the tools used by the AI should be credited with creation. This is framed as a proxy to understand people's feelings about generative AI. The lecture notes that the creativity still resides with the human who conceives the idea and uses the tool to bring it to fruition.

## Traditional Art vs. Digital Tools

The lecture contrasts traditional art creation, like painting by Raphael, with the creation of digital art, such as pixel art. It highlights the painstaking process of creating art pixel by pixel, emphasizing the human effort involved. The question is raised: if a computer is involved, does that diminish the human's role as creator? The lecture posits that AI can be viewed as just another tool, albeit a more sophisticated one, similar to how paintbrushes or computer software have advanced artistic capabilities.

## The Role of the Tool in Creation

A significant theme is the evolution of tools used in art. The lecture posits that AI can be viewed as just another tool, albeit a more sophisticated one, similar to how paintbrushes or computer software have advanced artistic capabilities. The argument is made that the creativity still resides with the human who conceives the idea and uses the tool to bring it to fruition.

## Deterministic vs. Non-Deterministic Processes

The lecture distinguishes between deterministic processes, where a procedure will always yield the same result, and non-deterministic ones, where outcomes can vary. This distinction is applied to art creation, particularly with AI. For instance, a deterministic procedure in code that creates a spinning graphic is contrasted with the varied outputs of AI models for the same prompt, suggesting that the non-deterministic nature of AI complicates claims of authorship. The lecture notes that if you start from scratch with tools like Blender, it's different from AI, which samples from previous works.

## Commissioning vs. Creating

The concept of "commissioning" is explored as a parallel to using AI. Just as one can commission an artist to create a specific piece, prompting an AI can be seen as commissioning it. However, the lecture questions whether commissioning an AI means the user can claim to have "created" the art, especially when the AI draws upon vast datasets of existing works. The lecture suggests that you can claim ownership of the commissioned work, but not necessarily that you "made and drew" it.

## The "Prompt Engineer" as Artist?

The role of the prompt in AI art generation is examined. The lecture questions whether a precisely engineered prompt, which guides the AI to produce a specific output, grants the prompter authorship. This is contrasted with the idea that the AI is "discovering" an image from a distribution of possibilities rather than truly creating something new. The lecture suggests that if the AI generates an image that is almost exactly as prompted, it's more like commissioning than creating.

## The "Collage" Analogy and AI's Reliance on Existing Data

The creation of AI art is likened to a collage, where elements from existing works are pieced together. This is because AI models are trained on vast datasets of human-created art. The lecture suggests that the AI is essentially sampling from these previous works, raising questions about originality and the extent to which the user can claim ownership when the AI's output is derived from others' creations. The lecture notes that AI reaches through other people's work that it has been trained on.

## The "Validation Engine" and Future of Design

The discussion extends to how AI might change professions like architecture. The idea is presented that future architects might act as "validation engines," using AI to generate designs based on specifications, and then refining those designs. This shifts the focus from manual creation to curation and validation, raising questions about the evolving definition of professional roles.

## Academic Integrity and AI

The lecture touches upon the implications of AI in academic settings, particularly regarding writing. The debate centers on whether using AI to write a paper, even if the student has read and agreed with every word, constitutes academic dishonesty. The argument is made that in contexts where the goal is to learn a skill, like writing, relying on AI bypasses the learning process.

## The Value of Foundational Skills

Despite the advancements in AI, the lecture emphasizes the continued importance of foundational skills. It argues that even with AI's capabilities, humans need the ability to verify and understand the outputs. The analogy is made to learning basic programming or mathematics; even if AI can perform complex tasks, understanding the underlying principles remains crucial for innovation and validation.

## Summary

*   AI art generation blurs the lines of authorship, prompting questions about who the true creator is: the human, the AI, or the tools it uses.
*   The evolution of artistic tools, from paintbrushes to AI, suggests that AI can be seen as a sophisticated tool, with human creativity remaining central.
*   The deterministic nature of traditional coding versus the non-deterministic outputs of AI complicates claims of ownership and creation.
*   The lecture explores whether prompting AI is akin to commissioning art, and the ethical considerations of using AI in academic and professional contexts.
