# Individual Responsibility vs. Company Policy

This lecture topic explores the tension between company mandates and individual ethical judgment, particularly when faced with complex situations. It questions whether companies can effectively dictate ethical behavior or if individuals must rely on their own moral compass to balance work obligations with personal principles.

## The Dilemma: Company Mandates or Individual Ethics?

The core question is whether a company can *mandate* specific actions or provide definitive guidance for employees in challenging situations. Alternatively, the situation might require *individual responsibility*, where a person must personally balance their work duties with their own ethical beliefs and what they perceive as right.

## The Reality of Work: Stakeholders and Performance

Students often express frustration because, ultimately, individuals have stakeholders to consider and are measured by their performance within the company. This means that while aspirational goals are good, the practical demands of the job and the need to work for the company are significant factors.

## Limitations of Oversight

The lecture acknowledges that even those who might criticize organizations for their policies cannot perfectly police individual behavior. It's impossible to constantly monitor everyone and ensure they are acting ethically in every instance.

## Summary

*   Companies may try to mandate or guide ethical behavior, but the effectiveness of this is questioned.
*   A significant part of navigating ethical dilemmas in the workplace falls on *individual responsibility*.
*   Individuals must balance their professional obligations and performance metrics with their personal ethical standards.
*   Ultimately, constant oversight to enforce ethical conduct is impractical.
