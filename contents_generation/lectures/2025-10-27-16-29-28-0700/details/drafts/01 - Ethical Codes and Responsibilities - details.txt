# Ethical Codes and Responsibilities

This lecture topic explores the nature and application of ethical codes for engineers and computer scientists, discussing their structure, limitations, and how they can be made more effective.

## The ACM Code of Ethics

The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) has a code of ethics that is broken down into sections. These sections cover general ethical principles for engineers and computer scientists, their professional responsibilities, and leadership principles for those who manage teams. The code also addresses how to be compliant with these ethical guidelines, even when in administrative roles.

## Guiding Principles and Aspirations

The ethical principles discussed are described as **aspirational**. Key principles include **avoiding harm**, **improving society as a whole**, and striving to be **fair and unbiased**. While aspirational, the question arises whether companies can mandate or provide specific guidance based on these codes, or if it ultimately falls to individual responsibility to balance work duties with personal ethical beliefs.

## Challenges in Practical Application

A significant challenge is that codes of ethics can be **too high-level to work effectively** on their own. The lecture suggests that relying on **critical incidents from the past** and drawing parallels to current decisions can help make ethical codes more concrete. This approach uses past ethical problems as examples to illustrate the code of ethics, providing a more tangible application.

## The Role of Examples in Ethical Codes

There is a perspective that even if a code of ethics is high-level and aspirational, it is still valuable because it focuses on **guiding principles** that individuals should keep in mind. The lecture mentions the Google code of ethics as an example, contrasting it with "life lessons" that might be given. The idea is that a code of ethics, especially when accompanied by examples, can **solidify understanding** and make the principles more actionable.

## Summary

*   Ethical codes, such as the ACM's, provide general principles and professional responsibilities for engineers and computer scientists.
*   These codes are often aspirational, emphasizing principles like avoiding harm and fairness.
*   A key challenge is that high-level codes can be difficult to apply practically.
*   Using past critical incidents and concrete examples can help make ethical codes more effective and understandable.
*   Ultimately, there's a balance between formal codes and individual responsibility in navigating ethical dilemmas.
