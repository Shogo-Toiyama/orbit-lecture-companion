# Challenges of Ethical Implementation and Enforcement

This lecture topic explores the difficulties encountered when trying to put ethical guidelines into practice and ensure they are followed. It highlights that existing codes of ethics can be too general to be effective and suggests that a combination of approaches might be necessary for successful ethical implementation.

## The Ineffectiveness of High-Level Ethical Codes

A significant challenge discussed is that **codes of ethics are often too high-level to work effectively**. This means that broad ethical principles may not provide enough specific guidance for real-world situations, making them difficult to apply in practice.

## Personal Experience with Draconian Measures

The lecturer shared a personal experience from the previous quarter where participation checks were implemented using a system called ICLIC. These checks involved logging in and taking participation tests. The lecturer found this system to be **"so draconian"** that they could not continue with it, ultimately giving up on the approach after the first four weeks. This illustrates a potential pitfall in enforcement: overly strict or impractical methods can lead to abandonment.

## Exploring Alternative Approaches

The discussion then moved to considering alternative methods for ethical implementation. Questions were posed to the audience about whether a **scenario-based approach** would be more effective. This suggests a potential solution to the problem of high-level codes by providing concrete examples and situations to guide ethical decision-making.

## The Need for Combined Strategies

Through audience interaction, it became apparent that a single approach might not be sufficient. When asked about different options, including "exemplary influence," the consensus indicated that **"we need both"**. This implies that a combination of strategies, potentially including scenario-based learning and other forms of influence or guidance, is likely necessary for effective ethical implementation and enforcement.

## Summary

*   **High-level codes of ethics are often too general** to be practically effective.
*   Overly strict or **"draconian" enforcement methods can be counterproductive**, leading to their abandonment.
*   A **scenario-based approach** is considered as a potentially more effective alternative.
*   The most effective ethical implementation likely requires a **combination of different strategies**.
