## The Jevons Paradox: Why AI Efficiency Might Not Save Us

Even as we strive for hardware that is "more energy efficient," the sheer scale of AI's growth means overall energy consumption continues to skyrocket, a phenomenon known as the **Jevons Paradox**. This economic principle suggests that as technological efficiency in using a resource increases, the rate of consumption of that resource can actually rise due to increased demand and accessibility. For AI, this means that even if individual chips or models become more efficient, the explosion in AI applications, users, and model complexity could lead to an even greater total demand for energy, making the goal of sustainable AI an uphill battle against *unsustainable growth*.

This paradox highlights why simply making AI systems more efficient isn't a silver bullet for the "requirements doubling every four years" problem. Just as more fuel-efficient cars led to more driving, more energy-efficient AI might just enable more AI, pushing us closer to the projection of AI demanding "20% of the entire U.S. electricity production" by 2030. It underscores the need for a multi-faceted approach, combining efficiency gains with responsible deployment, architectural innovations like *neuromorphic hardware*, and potentially even rethinking the scale and necessity of certain AI computations.

## AI's Hidden Thirst: The Water Footprint of Data Centers

While we often focus on electricity, a significant and often overlooked environmental impact of AI is its substantial demand for water, especially since "50%... dedicated to cooling the hardware and managing water usage." Data centers, the physical homes of AI, consume vast amounts of water to prevent their powerful servers from overheating. This water is used in cooling towers to dissipate heat, and while some systems are more efficient than others, the overall demand is immense, particularly in regions already facing water scarcity.

This "hidden thirst" directly impacts issues of *energy justice* and local environmental sustainability. For example, a single large data center can consume millions of gallons of water daily, putting a strain on local water supplies and ecosystems. As AI continues its rapid expansion, understanding and mitigating this water footprint becomes as critical as addressing its carbon emissions, pushing for innovations in **liquid cooling** and **closed-loop systems** to reduce reliance on fresh water.
