# Water Consumption and Ethical Allocation

This lecture explores the significant and often overlooked water consumption by the technology sector, particularly in semiconductor manufacturing and AI facilities. It delves into the critical ethical questions surrounding the allocation of scarce freshwater resources between technological advancement and fundamental human needs, highlighting the moral dilemmas faced by companies and society.

## The Significant Water Footprint of Technology

Water is used extensively in technology, not just for cooling but also for **semiconductor construction**. The amount of water projected for AI and related facilities is substantial, with estimates suggesting it could exceed half of the annual water use in the UK or be six times what is consumed in Denmark. Data centers, in particular, require a tremendous amount of water for cooling purposes.

## The Critical Need for Freshwater

While 70% of the Earth is covered in water, the critical issue is the availability of *freshwater*. The ions present in saltwater are problematic for semiconductor manufacturing, necessitating the use of **freshwater**, which constitutes only 3% of the Earth's total water. Furthermore, only about one-third of this 3% freshwater is actually available for use. This scarcity is a major concern, especially when considering that many people globally already lack adequate access to water.

## The Ethical Dilemma of Water Allocation

The lecture poses a significant ethical question: Is it justifiable to allocate scarce freshwater to AI and machines for purposes like searching for cat pictures, when billions of people lack adequate access to water or sanitation? According to the UN, 2.4 billion people face problems with inadequate sanitation. This presents a real ethical dilemma, where one perspective might argue that technological progress must continue regardless of such issues, while another advocates for a **utilitarian consideration** to help everyone as a whole. From an ethical standpoint, denying people access to water when it is diverted for technology is seen as problematic.

## Corporate Responsibility and Potential Exploitation

The discussion extends to the role of companies in this ethical landscape. While companies might have an incentive to recycle water to reduce costs, a concern arises if they can access cheap land and water supplies that negatively impact local populations without affecting their own bottom line. This scenario can be **exploitative**, raising questions about whether companies can be trusted not to harm local communities when establishing facilities like data centers. This situation is linked to the concept of a "race to the bottom," where companies might seek locations with fewer regulations or cheaper resources, potentially at the expense of local populations.

## Strategies for Water Conservation

Several strategies are being explored to address water shortages. In Taiwan, measures include **desalination**, **interbasin water transfer**, temporarily halting irrigation for farmland when food supply is sufficient, and **recycling**. Singapore provides an example of successful recycling practices in wafer and semiconductor plants, demonstrating that reducing water use in these industries is possible.

## Summary

*   The technology sector, especially semiconductor manufacturing and AI facilities, consumes a surprisingly large and growing amount of freshwater.
*   Despite Earth being mostly water, only a tiny fraction is accessible freshwater suitable for industrial and human use, making it a scarce resource.
*   A significant ethical dilemma exists in prioritizing water allocation between technological advancement and the basic human right to water, given that billions lack adequate access.
*   Companies face ethical scrutiny regarding their water usage, with concerns about potential exploitation of local populations if cheap water is sourced without considering community impact.
*   Solutions like desalination, interbasin transfer, and industrial recycling are being implemented to mitigate water scarcity in technology-intensive regions.

## Supplement: Explanation of Key Terms

*   **Desalination:** A process that removes salt and other minerals from saline water to produce fresh water suitable for human consumption or industrial use.
*   **Interbasin Water Transfer:** The artificial conveyance of water from one river basin to another, typically through canals, pipelines, or tunnels, to address water scarcity in the receiving basin.
*   **Race to the Bottom:** A socio-economic phenomenon where companies or governments compete by lowering standards (e.g., environmental protection, labor laws, resource costs) to attract investment or reduce production costs, potentially leading to negative consequences for communities and the environment.
