# Raw Material Extraction and Ethical Concerns

This lecture explores the increasing global reliance on raw materials for modern electronic devices and the significant ethical challenges associated with their extraction. It delves into the geopolitical risks, labor exploitation (including child labor), and environmental contamination linked to minerals like cobalt and rare earth elements, prompting a critical discussion on whether these practices represent exploitation or economic opportunity for developing nations.

## The Growing Demand for Raw Materials in Modern Devices

Modern electronic devices exhibit a **massive reliance on raw materials**, with increasing complexity requiring a greater variety of elements. For instance, phones in the 1960s used only about 10 elements, which grew to 27 by 1990, and further to 63 by 2021. This complexity means that a significant amount of raw material is needed for production; for example, 800 kg of raw materials are combined to make a 2 kg laptop.

## Key Raw Materials of Concern: Cobalt and Rare Earth Elements

The extraction of specific minerals, particularly **rare earth elements** and **cobalt**, has become a real limiting factor due to their critical role in these complex devices. These materials are central to the ethical and environmental discussions surrounding raw material sourcing.

## Geopolitical Risks of Cobalt Extraction

Cobalt is identified as a problematic mineral, with a significant portion of its supply originating from the **Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)**. It is anticipated that by 2030, 84% of cobalt mining will be concentrated in this single country, which presents considerable **geopolitical risk** due to such a high reliance on one source.

## Ethical Concerns: Labor Exploitation and Child Labor

A major ethical concern related to cobalt refinement is the **exploitation of labor**. The 2012 Dodd-Frank Act aimed to require companies selling to U.S. customers to disclose their raw material sources to ensure "conflict-free" supply chains. However, *cobalt was not included* in this act. In 2014, Amnesty International reported that approximately 20% of cobalt extracted from the DRC came from mines utilizing **child labor**. In response, Apple pledged in 2017 to treat cobalt as a conflict mineral, committing to reform its supply chain to eliminate child labor and other unethical practices. The lecture emphasizes that companies cannot simply abstract away from these issues and must be careful to avoid child labor.

## Environmental and Health Impacts of Rare Earth Element Extraction

Rare earth elements pose a different set of challenges, primarily due to their **extremely low recycling rate**. Furthermore, these elements can contain **radioactive elements**. When countries with valuable natural resources like rare earth elements try to extract them quickly to boost their economy, there is a significant potential to **contaminate local water and soil**. This raises an ethical question about whether extraction is done in a way that ensures the health of the local population or if it is exploitative, potentially leading to environmental disasters for developing nations.

## The Ethical Dilemma: Exploitation or Economic Opportunity?

The presence of high concentrations of these critical elements in developing countries presents a profound ethical dilemma. The core question is whether the extraction of these minerals constitutes **exploitation**, where more developed nations take advantage of the developing countries' situations, or if it represents an **opportunity**, providing a source of income that aids their economic development. This requires careful consideration of practices like child labor and ensuring that environmental disasters are avoided, rather than simply pursuing extraction "however we can."

## Summary

*   Modern electronic devices demand an increasing number and quantity of raw materials, leading to a massive reliance on extraction.
*   Cobalt and rare earth elements are critical minerals, with cobalt extraction concentrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo, posing geopolitical and ethical risks.
*   Significant ethical concerns include the **exploitation of labor**, particularly the use of **child labor** in cobalt mines, which companies like Apple have pledged to address.
*   Extraction of rare earth elements carries environmental and health risks due to their low recycling rates and potential for **radioactive contamination** of water and soil.
*   The overarching ethical question is whether raw material extraction in developing nations is an act of **exploitation** or an **economic opportunity**, requiring careful consideration of labor practices and environmental impact.

## Supplement

*   **Rare Earth Elements:** A group of 17 chemically similar metallic elements that are crucial components in many high-tech devices, including smartphones, computers, and electric vehicles. They are often found dispersed and mixed together, making their extraction and separation complex.
*   **Cobalt:** A metallic element primarily used in the production of lithium-ion batteries for electronic devices and electric vehicles, as well as in superalloys and pigments.
*   **Dodd-Frank Act:** A U.S. federal law passed in 2010 in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Section 1502 of the act specifically addresses "conflict minerals" (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries, requiring companies to disclose their use and source to ensure they do not fund armed conflict.
