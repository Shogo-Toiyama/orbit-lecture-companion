# CEV Methodology and Principles

The CEV methodology offers an indirect approach to instill human values into an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). It aims to create a trustworthy and safe ASI by extrapolating a general understanding of human values from diverse ethical systems, then deferring to the ASI for specific applications.

## Definition of CEV
The **CEV** (Coherent Extrapolated Volition) is described as an *extrapolated version* of human values. Its core idea is to give a computer, specifically a "seed computer," an *abstract general idea* about what human values look like. This approach contrasts with a direct method of uploading values.

## Why CEV is Proposed
The CEV methodology is presented as a *better way* compared to a "frontal direct way of trying to upload values." It is designed to overcome problems related to achieving a *trustworthy and safe ASI*, which were previously difficult to address. This indirect method is considered a *feasible way* to inform the computer about human values.

## Core Principles of CEV
A primary objective of CEV is to ensure *value alignment*, meaning the ASI does not "go its own way" but rather keeps *human beings in the loop*. A key aspect of this methodology is the **heuristic principle**, which dictates that the system will *defer to the ASI* regarding how to apply specific instances of the generalized human values. These generalized values are themselves extrapolated from various human systems.

## The CEV Methodology in Practice
The process of finding CEV involves several steps:
1.  **Baseline Creation:** It requires looking at a *baseline* composed of a wide variety of ways of thinking about values. This includes examining diverse *ethical systems* and various expressions of *ethical concerns* and *norms*.
2.  **Extrapolation:** From this comprehensive baseline, an *abstract generality* of what human values look like is derived or *extrapolated*.
3.  **Implantation:** This general abstract idea about human values is then *implanted into the computer*.

## Benefits and Difficulties of the CEV Approach
While implanting this abstract idea into the computer would "probably be very difficult," the CEV methodology offers the significant advantage of *offloading most of the work to the ASI itself*. This makes it a seemingly *feasible way* to inform the seed computer about human values.

## Summary of CEV
*   CEV is an indirect method for instilling human values into an ASI, aiming for trustworthiness and safety.
*   It involves creating a baseline from diverse human ethical systems and extrapolating a general, abstract idea of human values.
*   The "heuristic principle" allows the ASI to apply these generalized values in specific situations, deferring to its judgment.
*   The approach offloads much of the work to the ASI, despite the initial difficulty of implanting the abstract value idea.
*   The ultimate goal is to keep human beings in the loop for value alignment, preventing the ASI from acting independently.

## Supplement: Key Terms
*   **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence):** A hypothetical artificial intelligence that significantly surpasses human cognitive abilities across virtually all domains.
*   **Heuristic Principle:** A practical, problem-solving approach that employs a method not guaranteed to be optimal or perfect, but sufficient for achieving an immediate goal. In the context of CEV, it refers to the principle of deferring specific applications of generalized values to the ASI.
