# AI Intelligence Evaluation

This lecture explores the methods and considerations for evaluating the intelligence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. It emphasizes that intelligence is not a single measure, but a multi-dimensional concept, and highlights the fundamental differences between AI and human intelligence.

## The Purpose of Evaluating AI Intelligence

The primary goal is to assess the intelligence of AI systems and understand the mechanisms used for this evaluation. While the discussion acknowledges the broader scope of intelligence, it initially focuses on evaluating "intelligence" to understand how these systems perform.

## Beyond Raw Intelligence: A Multi-Dimensional View

The lecture advocates for evaluating AI intelligence using mechanisms that extend *beyond raw intelligence*. It is stressed that intelligence is *not just a single dimensional vector*; instead, it should encompass *emotional intelligence* and other dimensions. The idea that intelligence is not just one dimension is reiterated, suggesting that an AI solving complex chemistry problems or understanding poems doesn't automatically make it "better" than a human. While AI is observed to be *getting more emotional, intelligent*, there should still be *more dimensions* considered in its evaluation.

## AI Performance: The Case of GPT

When assessing AI performance, *earlier versions of GPT* were noted to have already *pretty much embarrassed us on most tests*. These AIs can *completely crush us* on certain tasks, such as solving chemistry problems or reading poems. However, it is also acknowledged that there are *certain tests* where these AIs may still encounter problems.

## Fundamental Differences in AI and Human Intelligence

A crucial point is that AI *is not going to be intelligent the same way that we are*. This difference is attributed to the fact that *the medium is different*. Specifically, AI *lacks the hormones that make our intelligence somewhat more emotionally intelligent*. Consequently, AI *won't be the same sentient the same way that we are*.

## Key Takeaways on AI Intelligence Evaluation

*   Evaluating AI intelligence involves assessing its performance using various mechanisms.
*   Intelligence is a complex, *multi-dimensional* concept that should include aspects like *emotional intelligence*, not just raw cognitive ability.
*   AIs, such as earlier versions of GPT, can significantly outperform humans on many tests, demonstrating superior capabilities in specific domains.
*   Despite impressive performance, AI intelligence is fundamentally different from human intelligence, primarily because AI *lacks the hormones* that contribute to human emotional intelligence and sentience.

## Supplement: Clarifying Key Terms

*   **GPT:** An acronym for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," referring to a type of large language model developed by OpenAI, known for its ability to generate human-like text.
*   **Sentient:** The capacity to feel, perceive, or experience subjectivity.
*   **Hormones:** Chemical messengers produced by the body's endocrine glands, which play a role in regulating various physiological processes, including emotions and cognitive functions.
