# AI Performance in Science

This lecture explores the significant capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific domains like biology, physics, and chemistry, demonstrating how some AI models can outperform human experts on specialized tests. It also highlights important considerations regarding potential biases and the risk of propagating misinformation within AI systems.

## Evaluating AI in Scientific Disciplines

AI models have been tested across various scientific fields, specifically **biology, physics, and chemistry**. These evaluations involved creating a set of questions designed for **experts** in each respective field. The results showed a notable difference, or "delta," between the performance of AI and human experts, particularly in chemistry.

## Performance of Specific AI Models: Grok

One AI model, **Grok**, demonstrated particularly strong performance in scientific tasks. On the **GPQA** test, Grok achieved an impressive **88.4%**, a score that "completely blew away even experts" in the specific fields of chemistry, biology, and physics. While Grok performed very well scientifically, it was also noted to have "some racist tendencies in some places."

## Challenges and Risks of AI in Scientific Information

Despite high performance, there are significant concerns about how AI models handle and perpetuate scientific information. A key risk arises if an AI model, such as **ChatGPT**, uses a scientific paper that contains incorrect information. If this wrong paper is then fed back into the AI model as part of its training or knowledge base, it could lead to a situation where "all the information might be wrong," creating a cycle of misinformation.

## Nuance in Assessing AI Superiority

The lecture also touched upon the idea that an AI's ability to solve complex chemistry problems that a human could not does not automatically mean the AI is inherently "better" than a human. This suggests a need for a more nuanced understanding of AI's role and capabilities beyond simple task completion scores.

## Summary

*   AI models have shown **expert-level performance** in biology, physics, and chemistry, even surpassing human experts on specialized tests like the GPQA.
*   **Grok** achieved an 88.4% on the GPQA, demonstrating its advanced capabilities in these scientific fields.
*   A critical challenge is the potential for AI models like **ChatGPT** to perpetuate and amplify misinformation if they are trained on or incorporate incorrect scientific data.
*   The lecture encourages a nuanced view, suggesting that an AI's ability to solve complex problems doesn't automatically equate to overall superiority over human intelligence.
