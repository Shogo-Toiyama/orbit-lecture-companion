# Ethical Frameworks and Decision Making

This lecture explores different ethical frameworks—deontological, utilitarian, and virtue ethics—as systematic approaches to making decisions and moral choices. It examines how these philosophical perspectives can be applied to understand everyday actions and address complex dilemmas, particularly in the field of computing. The discussion highlights that individuals often make choices in varied ways, and that a combination of frameworks may be necessary for navigating ethical quandaries.

## Understanding Ethical Frameworks

Ethical frameworks provide structured approaches to making decisions and choices, offering different philosophical perspectives on what constitutes "right" or "wrong." The lecture introduces three primary frameworks, using an analogy with characters from the MCU's Avengers to illustrate their core principles. These frameworks help analyze ethical dilemmas, filter arguments, and avoid biases.

## Deontological Ethics: The Path of Duty

**Deontological thinking** focuses on the inherent rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, *regardless of their outcome*. This framework emphasizes doing the right thing and making the correct choices based on moral duties or rules. Captain America is presented as an analog for this philosophy, embodying the idea of acting morally irrespective of the consequences. An example given is the choice, "I don't want to kill someone," when touching a switch, reflecting a decision based on a moral rule rather than the potential impact.

## Utilitarian Ethics: The Path of Consequences

**Utilitarianism** is an ethical framework that prioritizes the overall outcome or consequences of an action. Decisions are evaluated based on the "good and bad overall for a decision" and their "impact... on everyone else." Iron Man is suggested as a possible analog for utilitarian thinking, and a "very utilitarian solution" is described as one made without personal relationships influencing the decision.

## Virtue Ethics: The Path of Character

**Virtue ethics** is another framework introduced. The lecture mentions Iron Man as an "interesting choice" for virtue ethics and asks who embodies an "old fashioned kind of virtue ethics appeal." While the lecture introduces the term, it does not provide a detailed definition of virtue ethics beyond this association.

## Everyday Decision Making vs. Formal Frameworks

Most people, in their daily lives, do not consciously apply these formal ethical frameworks when making routine decisions, such as driving on the freeway. They often do not tend to think about the broad impact on everyone else. The lecture notes that individuals make choices in different ways, contrasting these everyday approaches with the more philosophical methods of decision-making.

## Navigating Complex Ethical Choices

The lecture explores whether these frameworks are entirely separate or part of a larger decision-making process. It suggests that while one can apply a framework for a more formal argument, different frameworks for right and wrong might be appropriate at different times. It is considered difficult to adhere to only one way of thinking, implying a need to utilize "different frameworks or different ways of exercising it" to find a "middle ground" in complex situations.

## Ethical Considerations in Computing

Ethical frameworks are particularly relevant in computing when addressing how decisions are made, how to handle ethical quandaries, and how to avoid biases. A key example discussed is the moral difference between a human driver and an autonomous vehicle. Questions arise regarding the legality and moral accountability of autonomous vehicles if their code, learning patterns, or test patterns lead to a "questionable" choice. This highlights the challenge of embedding ethical decision-making into technology.

## Factors Influencing Personal Choices

The lecture acknowledges that personal factors can significantly influence decision-making. A student's input suggests that a person's relationship with others, such as loving them, might influence their thinking and choices, especially in situations involving difficult moral dilemmas.

## Summary of Key Concepts

*   **Ethical frameworks** (deontological, utilitarian, virtue ethics) provide structured ways to approach moral decision-making.
*   **Deontological ethics** focuses on doing the *right thing* regardless of outcomes, exemplified by Captain America.
*   **Utilitarian ethics** prioritizes the *good and bad overall for a decision* and its *impact on everyone else*, with Iron Man as a potential analog.
*   **Virtue ethics** was introduced, though its definition was not detailed in the lecture.
*   Everyday decisions often differ from formal philosophical approaches, as people don't always consider broad impacts.
*   Applying ethical frameworks can be complex, often requiring the use of **multiple frameworks** or finding a "middle ground" depending on the situation.
*   Ethical frameworks are crucial for addressing dilemmas in **computing**, such as the moral and legal responsibilities of autonomous vehicles.
