# Implicit Bias and the IAT

This lecture introduces the concept of *implicit bias*, which refers to biases that may be hidden or not consciously recognized. It then explains the *Implicit Association Test (IAT)*, a Harvard experiment designed to provide an indication of such biases by measuring response times in categorization tasks.

## Understanding Implicit Bias

*Implicit bias* refers to a type of bias that some people question the possibility of, specifically how one's feelings about something could be *hidden* or not consciously known. While biases in general can inform our decision-making processes, implicit biases are distinct because they are not readily apparent to the individual holding them. The lecture notes that the Implicit Association Test (IAT) serves as an indication of this type of bias.

## Initial Questions and Challenges

During the discussion, some individuals in the class expressed skepticism, pushing back on the idea that it's even possible to have implicit biases. Their concern was centered on how one could have feelings or associations about something that are hidden from their own awareness.

## The Implicit Association Test (IAT) Explained

To illustrate and explore implicit bias, the lecture introduces an experiment called the *Implicit Association Test (IAT)*, developed at Harvard. This test is a keyboard-based experiment involving two different categorization tasks.

## How the IAT Measures Bias

The IAT involves a series of categorization tasks:
1.  **Categorizing Individuals**: Participants are shown pictures of individuals and asked to label them as "black" or "white" by pressing keys on either the left or right side of the keyboard. The assignment of "white" or "black" to a specific side is switched throughout the test.
2.  **Categorizing Words**: In a separate part of the test, participants are shown words and asked to categorize them as having a "good" or "bad" association by pressing keys on the left or right side.
3.  **Combined Task**: The core of the IAT involves combining these tasks. The test varied whether "white" was paired with "good" (meaning both are assigned to the same side/bucket) or "black" was paired with "good." The measurement focuses on the *amount of time* it takes participants to complete these combined categorization exercises.

## Key Findings from the IAT

The IAT experiment found a *significant difference* in the time it took participants to complete the combined categorization tasks. Specifically, there was a noticeable difference in how easy it was for people to perform the exercise when "white" was paired with "good" versus when "black" was paired with "good." This measured difference in response time is presented as one indication of an *implicit bias*.

## Future Discussion: Implicit Bias in AI

The lecture indicates that the topic of implicit bias will be discussed further, particularly in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This future discussion will explore what it means for algorithms to exhibit implicit bias, whether such biases originate from the data they receive from users or from assumptions built into their internal design.

## Summary of Implicit Bias and the IAT

*   *Implicit bias* refers to hidden or unconscious biases that individuals may not be aware of.
*   The *Implicit Association Test (IAT)* is a Harvard experiment designed to detect these biases.
*   The IAT involves categorizing images of people and words with "good" or "bad" associations.
*   It measures the *time difference* in categorizing when certain groups (e.g., "white") are paired with "good" versus others (e.g., "black") with "good."
*   A significant time difference in these tasks is considered an *indication of implicit bias*.
*   The concept of implicit bias is relevant to understanding potential biases in AI algorithms.

## Supplement: Clarifying Implicit Bias

While not explicitly defined in the lecture, the discussion implies that *implicit bias* refers to attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. The IAT is designed to reveal these automatic associations.
