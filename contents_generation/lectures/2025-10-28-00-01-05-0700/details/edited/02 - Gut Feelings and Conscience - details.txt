# Gut Feelings and Conscience

This lecture explores different internal drivers for decision-making, focusing on *gut feelings* as an intuitive pull towards what "feels right" or "technically sweet," and *conscience* as a moral compass guiding towards what is "correct." It also distinguishes these from immediate *emotions*.

## The Nature of Gut Feelings

A *gut feeling* is an approach to decision-making where something "just feels right." This involves an intuitive sense that an idea is correct, leading one to pursue it. The lecture notes that many different approaches are based on this idea: if you get a feeling that something is right, you just go for it.

## Oppenheimer's "Technically Sweet" Approach

J. Robert Oppenheimer's perspective illustrates a specific kind of gut feeling. He suggested that when one encounters something *technically sweet*, they proceed with it, only debating its implications after achieving technical success. This approach, while leading to scientific inspiration and excellence, contains both positive and negative aspects. Oppenheimer's drive was rooted in an interest in a topic and a feeling that it was right to pursue it, focusing on the "coolness" of an idea rather than its potential moral ramifications in the world.

## The Guiding Force of Conscience

*Conscience* represents another internal guide for decision-making, distinct from Oppenheimer's gut feeling. It involves listening to an inner sense of what is morally correct. Gandhi's view emphasizes conscience as a "Higher court" that "supersedes all other courts" when trying to make a right moral decision. This suggests conscience is a supreme authority in determining what is correct.

## Conscience in Moral Decision-Making

Conscience is characterized by an immediate feeling about one's actions in the present moment: "how do I feel about what I'm doing?" In the context of this class, if something like algorithmic bias "feels wrong to your conscience," it indicates a moral misalignment. While conscience seems to align with *deontological thinking*, the lecture notes that deontology might have a different emphasis.

## The Influence of Emotions

Emotions play a significant role in how many people make decisions, often providing a strong push into the decision-making process. However, the lecture distinguishes general emotions from the "it feels right" gut feeling described by Oppenheimer.

## Distinguishing Gut Feelings from Emotions

The lecture clarifies the difference between an emotional response and Oppenheimer's "it feels right" gut feeling. If one is emotional, upset, or acting in the "heat of the moment," they are likely going with what feels *emotionally* right. This differs from Oppenheimer's pursuit of a "technically sweet" or "cool" idea based on scientific interest, where the moral consequences might not be the primary consideration at that moment.

## Summary

*   **Gut Feelings** are intuitive senses that something "just feels right," leading to action, as exemplified by Oppenheimer's pursuit of "technically sweet" ideas.
*   **Conscience** acts as a moral compass, guiding decisions based on what is "correct" and superseding other considerations, as highlighted by Gandhi.
*   **Emotions** significantly influence decision-making but are distinct from Oppenheimer's gut feeling, which is driven by interest in a topic rather than immediate emotional reactions.
*   Oppenheimer's approach prioritizes scientific pursuit and the "coolness" of an idea, potentially deferring moral considerations.
*   Conscience prompts an immediate moral assessment of one's actions, such as recognizing algorithmic bias as wrong.

## Supplement: Deontological Thinking

*Deontological thinking* (or deontology) is a theory in ethics that judges the morality of an action based on whether the action adheres to a rule or rules. It is sometimes described as "duty" or "rule-based" ethics, where the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves are considered, rather than the consequences of those actions. The lecture briefly mentions that conscience seems to match deontological thinking, implying a connection to rule-based moral reasoning, though it also suggests a potential distinction.
