## Agile Development: The Industry's Embrace of Iteration

The modern software development world widely adopts methodologies like **Agile**, which perfectly mirrors the lecture's emphasis on an *“iterative approach”* to problem-solving. Instead of trying to design a perfect, complete solution upfront, Agile breaks down complex projects into small, manageable cycles called "sprints." Each sprint involves planning, development, testing, and review, allowing teams to continuously gather feedback, identify issues, and adapt their approach, much like forming and testing hypotheses in algorithmic design.

This industry practice directly reflects the idea that "many initial attempts and hypotheses are expected to fail," and that these failures are valuable for learning and evolving solutions. By embracing constant iteration and feedback, Agile teams can quickly pivot when an initial idea doesn't work, preventing large-scale failures and ensuring the final product effectively solves the user's problem, aligning with the lecture's focus on the **methodology** of problem-solving over specific, rigid solutions.

## The Original "Bug" in the Machine

The very term "debugging" in computer science has a fascinating origin that perfectly illustrates the lecture's point about *“learning from failures”* and the iterative process of refining solutions. In 1947, computer pioneer Grace Hopper and her team at Harvard discovered an actual moth trapped in a relay of the Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction. They carefully removed the moth and taped it into the logbook, coining the term "debugging" for the act of finding and fixing errors in a system.

This historical anecdote highlights that even in the early days of computing, identifying and rectifying unexpected issues—or "bugs"—was a crucial part of making algorithms and machines work correctly. It underscores the practical reality that solutions are rarely perfect on the first try, and that "reasoning about *why* an attempt failed" is fundamental to evolving one's thinking and ultimately achieving a correct and robust algorithm.
