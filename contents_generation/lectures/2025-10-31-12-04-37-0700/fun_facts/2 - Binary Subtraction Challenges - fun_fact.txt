## The Magic of Two's Complement: Subtraction as Addition

The elegant concept of *two's complement* allows computers to perform subtraction using the same hardware designed for addition, fundamentally simplifying processor design. While the lecture explains how an "end borrow" indicates a negative result and requires a correction by taking the *two's complement* of the number, the true genius lies in realizing that subtracting a number is mathematically equivalent to adding its two's complement. This means that instead of needing separate, complex circuits for both addition and subtraction, a computer's Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) can use a single adder circuit for both operations, significantly reducing hardware complexity and increasing efficiency.

This unification of arithmetic operations is a cornerstone of modern computer architecture. When a CPU needs to compute M - N, it doesn't actually perform a "subtraction" in the traditional sense. Instead, it calculates M + (two's complement of N). The result of this addition directly yields the correct signed difference, eliminating the need for the complex "manual borrowing methods" that are inefficient for computers. This clever trick directly addresses the lecture's point about "combining parts of the adder and subtractor into a common circuit" to achieve more efficient hardware implementation.
