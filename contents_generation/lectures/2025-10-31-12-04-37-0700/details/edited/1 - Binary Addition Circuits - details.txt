# 1. Binary Addition Circuits

This topic explores the fundamental building blocks of digital arithmetic, focusing on how computers perform addition using combinational logic circuits.
It details the design and function of basic components like the half adder and full adder, and how these are combined to create multi-bit adders, such as the ripple carry adder.

## ➕ Introduction to Arithmetic Circuits
Arithmetic circuits are combinational circuits designed to perform arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ⟦s000006⟧.
This lecture primarily focuses on developing circuits for binary addition and subtraction ⟦s000004, s000007⟧.
The approach involves a hierarchical, iterative design, starting with the simplest operation: adding two binary digits ⟦s000008⟧.

## 🔢 Adding Two Binary Digits
When adding two binary digits, there are only four possible combinations: 0+0, 0+1, 1+0, and 1+1 ⟦s000009, s000010⟧.
The results are:
*   0 + 0 = 0
*   0 + 1 = 1
*   1 + 0 = 1
*   1 + 1 = 2 (represented as binary 10)
⟦s000012⟧

For the first three cases, a single output bit is sufficient ⟦s000029⟧.
However, the sum of 1+1 requires two bits to represent the result (a sum bit and a carry bit) ⟦s000029, s000030, s000031⟧.

## 🧮 The Half Adder Circuit

### 📝 Definition of a Half Adder
A **half adder** is a purely combinational circuit that generates the sum of two binary bits ⟦s000032, s000033, s000034⟧.

### ➡️ Half Adder Inputs and Outputs
A half adder has two inputs, typically labeled X and Y, and two outputs: a *sum* (S) and a *carry* (C) ⟦s000035, s000038, s000039, s000046⟧.
The carry output is often referred to as `C_out` or `C_f` (carry forward) ⟦s000038, s000039⟧.

### 💡 Half Adder Truth Table and Boolean Expressions
The behavior of a half adder can be defined by a truth table based on the four possible input combinations ⟦s000040, s000047⟧:

| X | Y | Sum (S) | Carry (C) |
|---|---|---------|-----------|
| 0 | 0 | 0       | 0         |
| 0 | 1 | 1       | 0         |
| 1 | 0 | 1       | 0         |
| 1 | 1 | 0       | 1         |
⟦s000048⟧

From this truth table, the Boolean expressions for the outputs can be derived ⟦s000049⟧.
These expressions are:
*   The **Sum (S)** is 1 when X is 0 and Y is 1 (NOT X AND Y), or when X is 1 and Y is 0 (X AND NOT Y). This is equivalent to an **exclusive OR** operation: S = X XOR Y.
*   The **Carry (C)** is 1 only when both X and Y are 1. This is equivalent to an **AND** operation: C = X AND Y.
⟦s000050, s000051, s000052, s000053, s000054, s000055, s000056⟧

### ⚙️ Half Adder Circuit Implementation
The combinational circuit for a half adder can be easily drawn using an exclusive OR gate for the sum and an AND gate for the carry, both taking X and Y as inputs ⟦s000057, s000058, s000059, s000060⟧.

## ➕ The Full Adder Circuit

### 📝 Definition of a Full Adder
While a half adder can add two bits, it is insufficient for multi-bit addition because it cannot account for a carry-in from a previous, less significant bit position ⟦s000061, s000062, s000063⟧.
This limitation gives rise to the **full adder** ⟦s000064⟧.
A full adder is also a combinational circuit, but it generates the sum of *three* bits: the two input bits (X and Y) and a carry-in bit ⟦s000065, s000066⟧.

### ➡️ Full Adder Inputs and Outputs
A full adder has three inputs (X, Y, and a carry-in, `C_in` or Z) and two outputs (a sum bit, S, and a carry-out bit, `C_out`) ⟦s000067, s000070⟧.
The largest possible sum from three binary inputs (1+1+1) is 3, which requires two bits (binary 11) to represent, thus necessitating both a sum and a carry-out ⟦s000068, s000069, s000070⟧.

### 💡 Full Adder Truth Table and Boolean Expressions
With three inputs, a full adder's truth table has eight rows ⟦s000071⟧:

| X | Y | Z (`C_in`) | Sum (S) | Carry Out (`C_out`) |
|---|---|------------|---------|---------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0          | 0       | 0                   |
| 0 | 0 | 1          | 1       | 0                   |
| 0 | 1 | 0          | 1       | 0                   |
| 0 | 1 | 1          | 0       | 1                   |
| 1 | 0 | 0          | 1       | 0                   |
| 1 | 0 | 1          | 0       | 1                   |
| 1 | 1 | 0          | 0       | 1                   |
| 1 | 1 | 1          | 1       | 1                   |
⟦s000073, s000074, s000075, s000076, s000079, s000080, s000081, s000082, s000083, s000084, s000085, s000086, s000087⟧

The Boolean expressions for the sum (S) and carry-out (C) can be derived from this truth table ⟦s000089, s000090, s000091, s000092, s000093, s000094⟧.
Through algebraic manipulation, the expressions can be simplified:
*   **Sum (S)**: S = X XOR Y XOR Z
*   **Carry Out (C)**: C = (X AND Y) OR (Z AND (X XOR Y))
⟦s000103, s000104, s000105, s000106, s000107, s000108, s000109, s000110, s000113, s000114, s000115, s000116, s000117, s000118, s000119, s000136, s000121, s000122, s000123, s000124, s000125, s000126, s000127, s000128, s000129, s000130, s000131, s000132, s000133, s000134, s000137, s000138⟧

### ⚙️ Full Adder Circuit Implementation and Verification
A full adder can be constructed by combining two half adders and an OR gate ⟦s000142⟧.
The circuit implements the derived Boolean expressions for S and C ⟦s000139, s000140, s000141, s000157⟧.

The circuit's functionality can be verified by tracing various input patterns:
*   **0 + 0 + 0**: All inputs (X, Y, Z) are 0.
    The first XOR (X XOR Y) is 0, and the second XOR (0 XOR Z) is 0, so S=0.
    The AND gates produce 0, so C=0.
    The result is 00, which is correct.
*   **0 + 0 + 1**: With Z=1 and X=Y=0.
    The first XOR (0 XOR 0) is 0, and the second XOR (0 XOR 1) is 1, so S=1.
    The AND gates produce 0, so C=0.
    The result is 01 (binary 1), which is correct.
*   **0 + 1 + 1**: With Y=1, Z=1, and X=0.
    The first XOR (0 XOR 1) is 1.
    The second XOR (1 XOR 1) is 0, so S=0.
    The first AND (0 AND 1) is 0.
    The second AND (1 AND 1) is 1.
    The OR gate (0 OR 1) is 1, so C=1.
    The result is 10 (binary 2), which is correct.
*   **1 + 1 + 1**: All inputs (X, Y, Z) are 1.
    The first XOR (1 XOR 1) is 0.
    The second XOR (0 XOR 1) is 1, so S=1.
    The first AND (1 AND 1) is 1.
    The second AND (0 AND 1) is 0.
    The OR gate (1 OR 0) is 1, so C=1.
    The result is 11 (binary 3), which is correct.

## ⛓️ Multi-bit Binary Addition: Ripple Carry Adder

### 🔗 Combining Full Adders
Computers typically add multi-bit numbers, such as 64-bit numbers in modern processors ⟦s000219, s000220, s000221, s000222⟧.
To achieve this, full adders are combined in a chain to form a multi-bit adder, often called a **ripple carry adder** ⟦s000224, s000239⟧.

In a ripple carry adder, each full adder (FA) handles one bit position of the numbers being added ⟦s000227, s000228⟧.
For example, in a 4-bit adder:
*   The first full adder (FA0) adds the least significant bits (A0 and B0) and an initial carry-in (C_in0), which is typically 0.
    It produces a sum bit (S0) and a carry-out (C_out0).
*   This C_out0 then becomes the carry-in for the next full adder (FA1), which adds A1, B1, and C_out0.
*   This process continues, with the carry-out from each stage becoming the carry-in for the next, until all bit positions are added.
*   The final output includes the sum bits (S0-S3 for a 4-bit adder) and a final carry-out (C_out4), potentially resulting in a sum with one more bit than the inputs.
⟦s000229, s000237, s000238, s000230, s000231, s000232, s000233, s000234, s000236⟧

### 🐢 Challenges of Ripple Carry
The ripple carry design has a significant drawback: speed ⟦s000240⟧.
The carry signal must "ripple" through each full adder sequentially ⟦s000239, s000241⟧.
For numbers with many bits, this can be slow, as the output of higher-order bits cannot stabilize until the carry from all lower-order bits has propagated ⟦s000241, s000242⟧.

### ⚡ Improving Carry Propagation
To address the speed limitation of ripple carry adders, real-world computer implementations often incorporate complex combinational logic known as **carry look-ahead logic** ⟦s000244, s000245⟧.
This logic calculates higher-order carries more quickly by projecting them forward from lower-order carries, significantly speeding up the addition process ⟦s000247, s000248⟧.
Despite these optimizations, the fundamental principle of adding numbers remains rooted in the full adder's operation ⟦s000249, s000250⟧.
