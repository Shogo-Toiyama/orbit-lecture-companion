# Graph Algorithm Applications

Graph algorithms are fundamental tools for solving a vast array of real-world problems across diverse fields, extending far beyond traditional computing. Many complex situations can be effectively understood and addressed by modeling them as graphs and then applying established graph algorithms.

## The Broad Utility of Graph Algorithms
The knowledge of algorithm design, particularly graph algorithms, is valuable across many industries, not just in computing companies like Google or Microsoft. Fields such as Wall Street and law school increasingly rely on analytics, where graph algorithms play a significant role. This broad applicability stems from the fact that many real-world problems can be effectively represented and analyzed using graph structures.

## Core Principle: Modeling Problems as Graphs
A key reason for the widespread application of graph algorithms is their inherent structure. Understanding these algorithms helps in solving numerous problems by first *modeling them as a graph*. Once a problem is represented as a graph, existing algorithms designed for graphs can be directly applied to find a solution.

## Practical Problem-Solving with Existing Algorithms
When faced with a problem that can be modeled as a graph, existing graph algorithms can often solve a significant portion of it, typically around 70%. This means that rather than developing entirely new solutions, practitioners can leverage existing algorithms to address substantial parts of their challenges.

## Real-World Examples of Graph Algorithm Use
Many practical problems are naturally suited for graph modeling. Examples include determining optimal **airline paths** or **transportation paths**, analyzing **links in a computer network**, and understanding **electron transfer in an integrated circuit**. In **compiler design**, graph algorithms are used to model when a variable is "alive," allowing compilers to solve the graph problem.

## The Role of Topological Sort
**Topological sort** is a specific graph algorithm that is interesting in its own right. Its structure allows it to be used to solve many other problems, both within academic settings like this class and in professional applications beyond. Often, topological sort is not the entire solution but serves as *one of the steps* in a larger problem-solving process, with many applications utilizing it.
