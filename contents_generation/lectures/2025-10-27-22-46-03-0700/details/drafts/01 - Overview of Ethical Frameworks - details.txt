# Overview of Ethical Frameworks

This lecture introduces three fundamental ethical frameworks—consequential, duty-based, and virtue-based—that provide different lenses for evaluating actions and decisions. Students will be expected to apply these frameworks to various contexts.

## Purpose of Ethical Frameworks
The lecture aims to introduce three broad ethical frameworks that students will likely be asked to apply in an exam or other contexts. These frameworks represent an attempt to categorize and understand the wide spectrum of ethical ideologies.

## The Three Core Ethical Frameworks

### Consequential Frameworks
These frameworks are primarily concerned with the *actual outcomes or consequences* of a particular action when making a decision. The focus is on what results from an action.

### Duty-Based Frameworks
In contrast to consequential frameworks, duty-based frameworks are more concerned with an *agent's intent* behind an action, rather than the actual consequences that follow.

### Virtue-Based Frameworks
This framework focuses on the *ethical makeup of an agent*. It considers the character and moral qualities of the person making the decision.

## Distinguishing Between Frameworks
There is a pretty clear distinction between consequential and duty-based frameworks. Consequential frameworks emphasize quantifying the results of actions, while duty-based frameworks focus on the caliber of the actions themselves. However, the line between duty-based and virtue-based frameworks can be harder to delineate.

## Broader Landscape of Ethical Systems
While the lecture focuses on introducing these three basic frameworks, it acknowledges that there is a whole spectrum of different ethical ideologies. Many other ethical systems exist, even within the categories discussed, such as ethical egotism, eudaimonism, and the ethics of care. The three frameworks presented serve as an introduction, with many other interesting ones available for further exploration.

## Summary
*   The lecture introduces three broad ethical frameworks: consequential, duty-based, and virtue-based.
*   **Consequential frameworks** prioritize the *outcomes or consequences* of an action.
*   **Duty-based frameworks** focus on the *intent* of the agent performing the action.
*   **Virtue-based frameworks** consider the *ethical character or makeup* of the agent.
*   Students are expected to apply these frameworks, recognizing that they represent a simplification of a broader range of ethical ideologies.

## Supplement: Explanation of Key Terms
*   **Agent**: In the context of ethical frameworks, an *agent* refers to the individual or entity making a decision or performing an action.
