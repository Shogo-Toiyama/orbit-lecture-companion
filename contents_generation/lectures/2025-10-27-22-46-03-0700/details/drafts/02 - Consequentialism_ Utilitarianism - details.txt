# Consequentialism: Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical framework that focuses on the *outcomes* or *consequences* of actions to determine what is right. Its core idea is to maximize overall utility, which generally means promoting the greatest happiness and minimizing pain for the largest number of people, treating every individual equally in this calculation.

## Definition of Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is an ethical framework where the primary concern is the **actual outcomes or consequences** of a particular action when making a decision. It is the idea of maximizing *utility*, meaning one seeks an outcome that maximizes the **general good as a whole**. This framework suggests that better actions are those that promote **more overall happiness**, while pain is considered the opposite of happiness. Therefore, a decision involves a mental calculation of how much pain something causes versus how much pleasure or happiness it causes. A key principle, especially emphasized by Jeremy Bentham, is that one is supposed to **treat every person equally** in this calculation.

## Historical Figures in Utilitarianism

While many have explored this framework, the most prominent names associated with utilitarianism are **John Stuart Mill** and his predecessor, **Jeremy Bentham**.

## Core Principles of Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism aims to provide a concrete notion of what is right by evaluating outcomes. The process involves looking at the consequences of an action and trying to determine if it will **help more people than it hurts**. This involves a kind of "calculus" where the happiness or pleasure generated is weighed against the pain caused.

## Challenges in Measuring Utility

Applying utilitarianism presents several difficulties. It can be tricky to determine the *weight* of something being positive or negative. Specifically, it's challenging to quantify how much pleasure a particular idea gives one person versus how much pain it causes another, and how to define the utility to an individual.

## Key Criticisms of Utilitarianism

A common argument against utilitarianism is its potential **insensitivity to minority rights**. Because it focuses on maximizing the general good, the benefit to a larger group of people might outweigh any pain experienced by a smaller set of individuals, even when treating everyone equally in the calculation. This raises the fundamental problem that a basic utilitarian strategy could potentially **justify any action**, regardless of how cruel or evil it might be to some, as long as it leads to sufficient good outcomes overall. This leads to the question of whether some actions are just **inherently unethical** and should not be done, regardless of their potential positive outcomes.

## Bentham's Defense Against Criticisms

Jeremy Bentham, despite being a proponent of utilitarianism, faced criticism regarding its implications, particularly concerning issues like slavery. Critics argued that if only a subset of people suffered pain (e.g., enslaved individuals) but the pleasure to the majority was significant, utilitarianism might justify it. Bentham, who was against slavery, countered this by arguing that there was a **cost to one's own "soul"** or moral standing in performing such a cruel act. He believed that this internal cost would negatively impact the overall outcome, thus making the cruel action not truly utilitarian. He attempted to adapt the framework to address these concerns.

## Summary of Utilitarianism

*   Utilitarianism is a **consequentialist** ethical framework, meaning it judges actions based on their **outcomes**.
*   Its goal is to **maximize overall utility**, which translates to promoting the greatest happiness and minimizing pain.
*   It requires **treating every person equally** when calculating the balance of happiness and pain.
*   Significant challenges include **quantifying pleasure and pain** and defining individual utility.
*   A major criticism is its potential to be **insensitive to minority rights** and to justify cruel actions if they lead to a greater overall good.
