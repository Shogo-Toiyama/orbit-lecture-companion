# Dimensions of Ethical Ideologies

This lecture explores a framework for understanding different ethical ideologies by categorizing them along two primary dimensions: relativism and idealism. This approach helps to clarify the underlying principles that guide various ethical systems.

## The Two Core Dimensions of Ethical Ideologies
Ethical ideologies exist across a spectrum, and one framework, based on an older paper, proposes two key dimensions for classifying them: **relativism** and **idealism**.

## Understanding Relativism
The first dimension is **relativism**, which concerns the universality of moral rules.
*   **High relativism** means rejecting the possibility of relying on universal moral rules. Instead, ethical judgments are considered *relative to the specific situation* and what is happening at that particular point in time. This perspective would not be embraced by thinkers like Kant, who did not favor relativism.
*   **Low relativism** means adhering to moral absolutes. It suggests that one should judge actions based on principles or inputs that can *apply universally*, regardless of the specific situation.

## Understanding Idealism
The second dimension is **idealism**, which relates to the expected outcomes of ethical actions.
*   **High idealism** posits that if one performs the *right action*, it will *always* lead to the *right outcome*.
*   **Low idealism** acknowledges that even when attempting to perform the right action, there can be both good and bad outcomes, as this is simply the nature of how actions unfold.

## Categorizing Ethical Approaches
Several ethical approaches can be placed within this two-dimensional framework:
*   **Deontology** and, to some extent, **virtue ethics** are characterized by *high idealism* and *low relativism*. They are not situationally specific but expect positive outcomes from right actions.
*   **Consequentialism** and **utilitarianism** are described as having *low idealism* and *low relativism*. They also rely on universal principles but recognize that right actions don't always guarantee good outcomes.

## Other Ethical Perspectives
The lecture also briefly mentions other ethical systems:
*   **Situational ethics** is an example of *high relativism*, where choices are made based on what can be done to embrace love, making it highly specific to the situation. (Note: Students are not required to learn this for the class.)
*   **Ethical egoism** is another approach where *idealism is low*. It suggests doing whatever one wants based on self-interest, acknowledging that outcomes can be good or bad.
*   The **Communitarian approach** emphasizes that life is connected through enduring patterns, often tribal in nature, where the community as a whole guides ethical thinking. This involves wisdom from elders, community support (material and psychological), and shared meaning.
    *   A challenge with this approach is that focusing on what the community believes or what's in its best interest can *stifle the individual*. Deviations from community norms often create problems, and elders maintain high social standing even after they pass.
*   Other ethical systems like eudaimonism and the ethics of care exist, but the lecture's primary goal was to introduce the basic ones discussed within the dimensional framework.

## Summary
*   Ethical ideologies can be understood through two main dimensions: **relativism** and **idealism**.
*   **Relativism** determines if moral rules are universal (low relativism) or situation-dependent (high relativism).
*   **Idealism** reflects the belief that right actions always lead to right outcomes (high idealism) or can have mixed outcomes (low idealism).
*   Approaches like deontology and virtue ethics are high idealism/low relativism, while consequentialism and utilitarianism are low idealism/low relativism.
*   Other systems like situational ethics and ethical egoism illustrate different points on these dimensions, and communitarianism offers a community-focused perspective with its own challenges.
