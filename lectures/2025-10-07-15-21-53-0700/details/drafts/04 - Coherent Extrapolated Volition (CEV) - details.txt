# Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)

Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) is a concept that aims to define what humanity would truly desire if it possessed enhanced cognitive abilities and sufficient time for reflection. It involves extrapolating our wishes under ideal conditions and then coherently integrating these values to guide a computer's decision-making.

## Definition of Coherent Extrapolated Volition
The core idea of **Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)** is to determine *what we would wish were we to know what we really want*. This concept seeks to understand humanity's true desires under optimal conditions.

## Components of CEV: Extrapolation
The "extrapolated" aspect of CEV refers to imagining our wishes if we were *brighter*, had *more time to think*, and were able to think *convergentl*y. This means considering values in a way that is *inclusive of many different ways of thinking about values*, rather than thinking divergently. This process of imagining our desires under improved cognitive and temporal conditions forms the notion of extrapolation.

## Components of CEV: Coherence
The "coherence" part of CEV involves *bringing all these extrapolated wishes and values together in an abstract way*. This integration is crucial for creating a unified framework.

## Purpose of CEV for Computers
The ultimate purpose of this coherent integration is to *give a computer a basis for doing what it's about to do with respect to specific decisions that it will subsequently make*. Essentially, CEV provides a foundational set of values for an artificial intelligence to guide its actions.

## Summary of CEV
*   **Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)** defines what we would truly want if we fully understood our desires.
*   It involves imagining our wishes if we were *brighter* and had *more time to think*.
*   This process requires *convergent thinking*, which includes many different ways of valuing things.
*   The "coherence" aspect brings these extrapolated wishes together abstractly.
*   CEV serves as a basis for computers to make specific decisions based on these integrated values.
