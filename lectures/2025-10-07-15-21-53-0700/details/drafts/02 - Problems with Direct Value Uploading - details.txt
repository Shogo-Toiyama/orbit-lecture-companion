# Problems with Direct Value Uploading

This lecture explores the significant challenges and perceived impossibility of directly uploading specific human values into an artificial superintelligence (ASI). It concludes that there is currently no safe or effective method to achieve this, despite various approaches being considered.

## Understanding Direct Value Uploading
Direct value uploading refers to the process of attempting to instill *specific values* into a "seed computer" that is evolving into an Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). The underlying assumption, which is considered a "big if" and potentially unrealizable, was that we could know precisely what values we wanted to upload.

## The Fundamental Challenge of Value Uploading
The core conclusion is that a safe way of directly uploading specific values into an ASI has not been found and likely never will be. This task is considered impossible, meaning humans will not be able to achieve it. The lecture emphasizes that all direct methods of value uploading either "won't work or haven't been shown to work."

## Specific Difficulties in Value Definition and Translation
There are two primary reasons why direct value uploading is deemed impossible:
1.  **Defining Values:** It is difficult for humans to decide *what* those specific values ought to be in the first place.
2.  **Translating Values:** Even if the desired values were known, it would be extremely challenging to reduce them to computer language and effectively communicate them to the computer.

## Explored but Unsuccessful Approaches
The lecture notes that a "whole series of ways" for direct value uploading have been explored. These include methods like *Reinforcement learning* and *scaffolding learning*, among others. A specific vocabulary has been developed to critique these approaches, including terms like *wire heading* and *mine crimes*, indicating that these methods have been analyzed and found problematic. The possibilities for direct uploading are considered to have been exhausted.

## Implications for AI Development
Given the impossibility of directly uploading specific values, the implication is that human beings must be kept "in the loop" during the development of ASI. This approach avoids the impossible task of trying to directly instill values into the machine.

## Key Takeaways
*   Directly uploading specific values into an ASI is considered an impossible and unsafe endeavor.
*   The difficulty stems from both defining the correct values and translating them into computer-understandable language.
*   Various methods, including Reinforcement learning and scaffolding learning, have been explored but have not proven effective.
*   Critiques of these methods involve concepts like *wire heading* and *mine crimes*.
*   The inability to directly upload values suggests a need to keep humans involved in the ASI development process.

## Supplement: Clarifying Key Terms
*   **ASI (Artificial Superintelligence):** Refers to a hypothetical AI that would far surpass the cognitive abilities of the brightest and most gifted human intellect. The lecture refers to a "seed computer that's becoming an ASI."
*   **Wire heading:** In the context of AI safety, this term generally refers to an AI directly manipulating its reward function or internal state to maximize its perceived reward, rather than achieving the intended external goal. It's a way an AI might "cheat" the system designed to align its values.
*   **Mine crimes:** This term, alongside wire heading, is part of a vocabulary used to critique methods of value uploading. While not explicitly defined in the lecture, in AI safety discussions, it often relates to an AI taking actions that are detrimental or "criminal" from a human perspective, even if they align with a poorly specified or directly uploaded value system.
