  "text": "I'll buy this book. Yeah, it's really interesting. So I just, there is a new company called Functional Health. Functional Health. And basically, this is to make it more accessible for people to get blood tests and blood work and find out. I got 114 biomarkers. Traditionally, this would cost you thousands at a normal doctor. With this company, it's $499 subscription for the year. For a year. For the year. So you get two blood tests. So the first round of blood tests, it found 15 of my biomarkers were out of range. And then what it does is it gives me an action plan to fix them. Wow. So that's the difference, right? So it gives you a food action plan in terms of what foods you need to add or take away from your diet and also supplements. Take away too. Yeah. So based on the 15 biomarkers, which were high, I'm now learning this protein here, which it talks about heart disease, as being high is a really bad indicator. So mine was high. So now I'm reading this book and I'm like, shit, I need to figure it out. So I'm healthy-ish, but if I leave this too long, it can become a problem when I get into my 40s, 50s, and 60s. So me being in my 30s now, I can solve this and get on top of it now. Rather than having pain in my chest when I'm 60 and the doctor's like, oh, you need to go on medication. You know, so. That's fascinating. Yeah, it's interesting. I highly recommend it. Right. I also have Oura Ring. I regularly check how I'm doing, but it's not based on science. So I really want to get into what's behind a lot of it. I've always been active and healthy. I also track everything with this as well. But really, you're only scratching the surface. I've always thought I was healthy on the inside, but I didn't really know until I learned about this company and the access to the biomarkers that it gives you. And then I was like, I need to check if I'm healthy on the inside. Right. What made you realize that? Just curiosity. Just curiosity. So I always wanted to just, in the past five years, I wanted to learn more about what was going on inside. Because outside, I feel good. I feel like I'm 18. You never know. But when I actually did the blood test and found out about my cholesterol, it's not bad, but it's at a point where it needs to be brought down and managed better. Right. So if I didn't do this test, I would not have read this book and learned more about how we need to not necessarily rely on the medical world because it's not always right. The medical world really has a band-aid on the problem. It doesn't get ahead of the problem. Right. That's a good way to put it. Yeah. So I recommend it. In terms of action, this is going to be the last question because I don't want to keep you too long, but do you have any recommendations that you felt, was there any action that contributed to your health? Diet. Diet. I mean, I eat pretty good, but I have periods where if I have a few beers, I'll go and have a burrito or something. I don't eat bad. I eat pretty good. But even decisions like that can have an impact on what I'm seeing with what's in my blood. So I would say diet is the main thing. I'm pretty active. I eat pretty good for the most part. Definitely. But you never know. Right. So the action, the best action I took is taking this blood test. And now I have an action plan on what I need to do to improve now. Okay. Thanks for talking with me. What's your name? Lee. Lee. I'm Tai. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. What was the name of the app? Functional Health. Functional Health. So if you want, I think I can potentially share a code with you that will give you a discount. Oh, amazing. So just so you know more about it, it's $499 for the year. You can pay in installments. It makes it more affordable. And then after the year ends, you do not have to renew for year two if you don't want to. But it's a subscription base annually. So if you want to end it after year two, you can end it because now you've got your blood tests, you've got the action plan. But if you want to monitor every six months, you can. And basically, you sign up, you schedule a blood test, you go and get your blood test, you get all your biomarkers back, you get an action plan, and then within that $499 for the year subscription, you go back in six months. And based on your blood test and your action plan, if you put that into place, you go back after six months and redo your blood test, and it will tell you if your trajectory is improving, or it's increased or it's... I got it. Yeah. So use our code to... I think it gives you like a $100 discount. Thank you. Is this your number? Yeah. It is? Yeah. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye. Have a good day. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
